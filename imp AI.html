    <h1><b>Importance of artificial intelligence</b></h1>
    <p>Obviously, artificial intelligence has enormous ramifications for almost every human endeavor<br>
         that you can imagine -- including investing. Imagine a robo-advisor that automatically tracks your portfolio<br>
          and maximizes its value by making immediate and personalized adjustments based on corporate earnings calls,<br>
           currency fluctuations, or even weather forecasts.

        It’s a tempting vision, but one with downsides. Artificial intelligence costs money, making it (for now) the province of wealthy<br>
        corporations. Even AI designers can’t anticipate every potential pitfall. And, of course,<br>
        there’s always the end-of-the-world scenario where AI winds up deciding that humans just aren’t worth the trouble<br>
        \(think “The Matrix” or “Terminator” movies).
        
        Many questions related to AI are just now being asked; they may be decades from being answered. But it’s a good idea<br>
        to keep track of this megatrend, which stands to affect the world in ways that we likely can’t yet imagine.</p>
